This software project includes two example source code implementations for ECI analysis, written in C# and JAVA (to satify both PC and Android). It can analyse and process both string and byte sequences into ECI segments, then translate these into the ECI-escaped byte sequences needed by algorithms used in two-dimensional barcode encoding and decoding.
